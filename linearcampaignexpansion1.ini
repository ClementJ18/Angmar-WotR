;
; LinearCampaignExpansion1 INI file Layout
; This is the master control file for Generals / Zero-Hour / B4ME2(?)-style campaigns.
; That is, campaigns which are simply a linear sequence of RTS maps, with nothing but a
; little UI / movie in between them. (As opposed to B4ME1-style, which involved transitions
; to the World Map after each mission -- B4ME1 did not use this file at all.) 

; Note that campaign names are basically hard-coded into the game engine. It would
; be nice to pull them from the flash file or something but... we don't. They must be
; named ANGMAR_CAMPAIGN
